        <p class="lead">We're after talks about stupidly overengineered projects that serve no particular purpose. Things that Heath Robinson would be proud of.</p>
        <p>For instance, if you've put an REST API on your shed (you know who you are). Or you have built a car entirely out of spoons. Could be code, could be hardware, could be entirely non-computer-related. The main thing is, you did something in an excessively complicated way for fun. Come and tell us how, and why.</p>
